GRAPHICS QUALITY

Note that Open Rails isn't registered with NVidia or ATI so it will run
with global settings by default.  For best image quality customize
the graphics settings in your video card control panel. If you are
setting up a program-specific custom setting, it's the OPENRAILS.EXE program
in the ORTS folder that you must select.
