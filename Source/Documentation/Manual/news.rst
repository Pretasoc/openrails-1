*******************
New in This Release
*******************

Here are the features which have been added or substantially changed since
v1.0 was released:

- Further enhanced compatibility with MSTS content
- Extended engine brake to tenders (A6ET brake)
- Keyboard commands for fast throttle and brake zeroing
- Support for domain names in multiplayer
- Further improvements towards realistic train physics, among this steam 
  heating for steam locomotives 
- Multiple freight animations on single wagon or engine; wagon freight 
  load/unload
- Water refueling from trough
- New sound triggers related to brakes 
- New sound triggers related to curve force (e.g. for flange squeal)
- Support for auxiliary tenders
- Blended braking
- Switching to manual mode also at speed
- Direct access to OR documentation from main menu

The features which have been added or substantially changed since
v0.9 was released:

- Train operation accordingly to timetables in .csv format, entered with
  a specific editor
- Support for languages other than English
- Support of 3D cabs
- Train physics far more realistic than in MSTS
- A *Timetable* mode

Some experimental features have been added which you can turn on; some of
them may affect performance. They include (v1.0):

- Conditional permission for AI trains to pass a signal at stop 
- Further improvements to AI train shunting
- Optional runtime correction for braking parameters (improves driveability)

v0.9:

- Compatibility with MSTS environment files
- Extended AI train shunting
- Adhesion linked to weather
- Support for DDS textures
- Extended viewing distance
- The ability to change the driven train during an activity
- Weather controlled within an activity (dynamic weather)
- Water fill from water troughs is now implemented.
- The Start/Stop keys for Diesel locomotives have changed.

The overall code architecture has been cleaned up, providing better separation 
between simulation and viewing.

... and again, many many bugs were removed.
